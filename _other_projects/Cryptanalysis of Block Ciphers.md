This repository provides implementations for:
1. AES: Encryption and decryption for AES-128, AES-192, AES-256, based on the NIST specification.
2. HM Heys' tutorial on linear and differential cryptanalysis: Heys' toy cipher, generic linear and differential attacks and characteristic solvers.
3. N Mouha et al.'s paper on proving security bounds against differential and linear cryptanalysis using MILP: Program generators for proving Enocoro-128v2's security against linear and differential attacks, and AES's security against differential attacks.
